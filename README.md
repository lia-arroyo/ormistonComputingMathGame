Created by Lia Arroyo and Bun Thong Chea, 2020.

A simple Python Math quiz complete with Tkinter GUI and error handling, in collaboration with Bun Thong Chea (@Bunthong1). This program was my first experience with classes (and OOP), coding as a team, and creating GUIs on Python. This was part of my NCEA L3 Computer Science project.

You can watch a video walk-through of the program here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqo2XEk-Vq4&list=PLVd20K8NxFDun5uDKucOP317jDSZ_7pdM&index=2
