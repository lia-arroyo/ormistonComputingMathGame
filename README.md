# ormistonComputingMathGame
A simple Python Math quiz complete with Tkinter GUI and error handling, in collaboration with Bun Thong Chea. This program was my first experience with classes (and OOP), coding as a team, and creating GUIs on Python. This was part of my NCEA L3 Computer Science project.
